# md-study-tool

This is a MD parser -- a study tool, to be more specific, which is designed to take in a target term and find terms to quiz the user on. 

## Installation
At the time of my writing this, I have not added any official releases; the only way for you to use this is to download this repository and build the source code. 
Here is a brief summary on how to do that.

1. Download the repository
2. Install .NET Core (if it is not already installed)
3. Go to the root folder of the project (where .sln is located).
4. run 'dotnet restore' via a command line
5. run dotnet build'
6. this will create an output folder where the .exe can be located
OPTIONAL: install Visual Studio and open the project with VS


## Usage
