# StudyTool

This is a MD parser -- a study tool, to be more specific, which is designed to take in a target term and find terms to quiz the user on. 

## Installation
At the time of my writing this, I have not added any official releases; the only way for you to use this is to download this repository and build the source code. 
Here is a brief summary on how to do that.

1. You need to download the repository
2. Install .NET Core
3. Go to the root folder of the project (where .sln is located).
4. run 'dotnet restore' via a command line
5. run 'dotnet run' or dotnet build'
OPTIONAL: install MS Visual Studio and open the project using that.

## Usage
TODO: write usage section LOL
